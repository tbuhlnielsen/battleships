# Battleships

## Description

You and the computer each command a fleet of ships: a carrier,
a battleship, a destroyer, a submarine, and a patrol boat.

You start by placing these ships in secret locations on your own
10 * 10 "primary" grid; they take up 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 squares
respectively, and may be placed horizontally or vertically.

You then take turns guessing where your opponent's ships are,
firing shots at squares on their primary grid. You record your
guesses on your "tracking" grid, which is shown to you each round.
If the computer hits one of your ships then you will be shown
your primary grid.

A ship sinks when all of the squares it occupies have been hit
by shots, and the winner is whoever sinks their opponent's fleet
first.

## How to play

During setup, define where you want to place of each of your ships
by entering a coordinate (a letter-number pair, e.g. a4) and an
orientation ('h' for horizontal or 'v' for vertical).

Enter a coordinate in the same format when asked where you want
to fire a shot.

## To do

* Add a 'quit' command.
