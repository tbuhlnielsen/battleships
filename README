BATTLESHIPS

A board game for you and your computer.

1. Description

Each player has five ships: a carrier, a battleship, a destroyer, a
submarine, and a patrol boat. At the start of the game, the players
place their pieces on a 10-by-10 grid; they occupy 5, 4, 3, 3, and 
2 squares respectively, and each must be placed in a line. Below is 
an example of a valid setup.

    a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j  
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
0 |   |   |   |   |   |   | D | D | D |   |

5 |   |   |   |   | C | P | P |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
8 |   | B | B | B | B |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Once both players have chosen positions for their ships, they take 
it in turns to fire shots at their opponent's ships. On your turn, 
you announce a square on which you think your opponent has a ship. 
Your opponent then replies with "hit" or "miss". The results of your 
previous guesses are recorded on a second 10-by-10 grid. 

The game ends when one player's fleet has been sunk (every square of 
every one of their ships has been hit).


2. Building

A Makefile for macOS (tested on Catalina) is included in the 
project's root directory.


3. To do

* Add more detail to Game::print_summary().
* Allow user to enter keywords "ships", "undo" and "quit".
* Systematic computer AI.
* Multiplayer?
* Replace static casts with function.
